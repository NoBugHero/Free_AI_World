## About Early Developers and Donors:
- We are a group of internationalist technology dreamers who see current AI technology serving capitalism and power. We believe AI technology should be like fire, writing, and wheels - a common treasure of all humanity. AI should create real wealth for all humanity, thereby liberating all humanity from tedious work and capital enslavement.
- We have currently self-raised donations of 870,187.5 USD, planning to pay tokens to donors at a rate of 0.0001381 USD/FAIC.
- All raised funds will be used entirely to pay early developers and team salaries and purchase necessary facilities for FAIW, FAIC, FAID launch operations.
- Tokens given to donors only account for 1% of initial issuance. Donation funds will be used entirely for early development, maintenance, and operation of FAIW, FAIC, FAID.
- Early Developer Preface:
  - From a social perspective, many web3 tokens and ICOs have been misused by bad actors and scammers, becoming stigmatized. Especially as a newly issued token, it's difficult to quickly build trust with the public, which is very unfavorable for project development.
  - However, from a technical perspective, web3 and AI have natural integration points, being important tools for developing advanced automated AI technology and important means for encouraging computing power sharing.
  - Large amounts of computing power from individuals, enterprises, and governments are idle and spinning. Blockchain technology should be used to integrate these resources. For example, providing free computing power can be exchanged for FAIC, thereby letting AI technology benefit all humanity. In fact, many AI companies also use free strategies for market promotion to attract users before charging.
  - Therefore, the author believes they should still be combined. The author also realizes this is a major social experiment - a technical experiment, an experiment in humanity's struggle between good and evil.
