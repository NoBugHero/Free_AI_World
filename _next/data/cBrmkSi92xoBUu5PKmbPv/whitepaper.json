AI should create real wealth for all humanity, thereby liberating all humanity from tedious work and capital enslavement.\n- We have currently self-raised donations of 870,187.5 USD, planning to pay tokens to donors at a rate of 0.0001381 USD/FAIC.\n- All raised funds will be used entirely to pay early developers and team salaries and purchase necessary facilities for FAIW, FAIC, FAID launch operations.\n- Tokens given to donors only account for 1% of initial issuance. Donation funds will be used entirely for early development, maintenance, and operation of FAIW, FAIC, FAID.\n- Early Developer Preface:\n  - From a social perspective, many web3 tokens and ICOs have been misused by bad actors and scammers, becoming stigmatized. Especially as a newly issued token, it's difficult to quickly build trust with the public, which is very unfavorable for project development.\n  - However, from a technical perspective, web3 and AI have natural integration points, being important tools for developing advanced automated AI technology and important means for encouraging computing power sharing.\n  - Large amounts of computing power from individuals, enterprises, and governments are idle and spinning. Blockchain technology should be used to integrate these resources. For example, providing free computing power can be exchanged for FAIC, thereby letting AI technology benefit all humanity. In fact, many AI companies also use free strategies for market promotion to attract users before charging.\n  - Therefore, the author believes they should still be combined. The author also realizes this is a major social experiment - a technical experiment, an experiment in humanity's struggle between good and evil.\n-----------------------------------------\n## FAIC Feature Introduction:\n1. FAIW promotes and builds the FAIC blockchain, using FAIC's layered architecture and PoS consensus mechanism, meeting FAIC's ERC20 standard.\n2. FAIC Node Functions:\n   1. Provide Computing Power\n   2. Provide Routing Services\n   3. Verify other nodes' computing power and routing services\n3. FAIC Program comes in two versions\n4.

FAIC node program, without FAID functionality.\n - Targeted at individuals, enterprises, governments; personal computers, servers or server centers; providing computing power nodes, validator nodes, routing nodes.\n - Validator node program suitable for low-performance computers and servers.\n - Computing power node program suitable for high-performance computers and servers, server centers, should consider parallel operation of hundreds or thousands of servers in server centers.\n - Program should be compatible with common server systems like Ubuntu, CentOS, Debian, Windows Server etc.\n6. FAID and FAIC integrate all ollama functionality, periodically retrieving model lists, model names, model descriptions, model downloads.\n-----------------------------------------\n## Ways to obtain FAIC.\n   **Warningüö®üö®üö®**\n   - FAIC is only applicable in countries and regions where blockchain and digital currency are legal.\n   - FAIC is not applicable to mainland China and other regions that restrict blockchain and digital currency.\n   - FAIC is not applicable to countries and regions with strict restrictions on blockchain and digital currency, and their residents, enterprises, and organizations.\n   - FAIC acquisition methods are subject to FAIW supervision, and FAIW has the right to adjust FAIC acquisition methods.\n   - FAIC, FAID, FAIW will not actively promote FAIC acquisition methods to you.

Computing power nodes may configure multiple AI large models and run simultaneously.\n  7. When multiple users simultaneously use the same computing power node, time ordering may be required based on node hardware conditions to process computing power requests sequentially.\n  8. After users initiate computing power requests, routing nodes automatically match the fastest computing power node with corresponding AI model, maintaining connection with that node's model until user chooses to end task or within 2 hours to achieve AI short-term memory preservation capability. After 2 hours, node automatically closes and deletes current request and request information.\n  9.
